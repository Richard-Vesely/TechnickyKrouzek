# Challenge: Make Your Own Arduino Library

**Goal:** Learn how to make your own Arduino library.

---

## Why is this important?

Think about making a **sandwich**.  
You take **bread**, **cheese**, and **ham** ‚Üí put it together ‚Üí you have a sandwich. Easy!  

But what if you had to make the **bread from wheat**, the **cheese from milk**, and the **ham from a pig**?  
That would be super hard. Maybe even impossible.  

üëâ Using a library in code = making a sandwich with bread, cheese, and ham.  
üëâ Not using a library = starting with wheat, milk, and a pig.  

Libraries are **super useful**. They save time.  
And the best way to understand them is to **make one yourself**.

---

## Steps

### 1. Open the project folder
Go here:  
[Arduino custom library demo](https://richard-vesely.github.io/ArduinoProjekty/#Arduino_custom_library_demo_IR_remote)

You will see 3 folders:
- `Arduino_custom_library_demo_WITH_library` ‚Üí code that **uses a library**  
- `Arduino_custom_library_demo_WITHOUT_library` ‚Üí code that **does not use a library**  
- `MyIRcodes` ‚Üí the **custom library**  

---

### 2. Run code without library
Open the folder `WITHOUT_library`.  
Connect Arduino. Run the code.

---

### 3. Run code with library
Open the folder `WITH_library`.  
Run it.  
üëâ You will get an **error**.

---

### 4. Fix the error
Ask **ChatGPT** for help.  
‚ö†Ô∏è Do not just copy blindly.  
Think about your question.  
Better question = better help.

---

### 5. Compare the two codes
Answer these:
- Which code is shorter?  
- Why?  
- What is the difference?  

---

### 6. Think about libraries
What is the **advantage** of using a library in this case?  
Write your answer.

---

### 7. Make your own library
With ChatGPT, make a new library.  
- Call it `TomsIRCodes` (or another name).  
- Take the code from step 2 (`WITHOUT_library`).  
- Change it so it uses your new library.  

Now you have your own library!

---

### 8. Extra (only if you want)
Read the ‚ÄúChatGPT project settings‚Äù in the resources.  
Ask yourself:  
- What problems happen if we don‚Äôt use this prompt?  

Ask ChatGPT to explain.

---

### 9. Update the instructions
Add a new instruction from step 8 into the project.

---

üëâ Done! You made and used your own Arduino library.

These are the instructions for chatGPT

When writing Arduino code that uses an IR remote, look for which option I specify
- Never hardcode raw hex IR values directly in sketches.

- For logic, always compare against my constants:
  if (signal == ONE) { ... }
  switch (signal) { case LEFTBTN: ... }

- If NEC repeat (0x0) occurs, either ignore it or reuse the last non-repeat button as appropriate.

- When troubleshooting, always include Serial output showing both the raw code and the readable label using my constants.

- When handling IR input, read the raw code with:
  unsigned long signal = IrReceiver.decodedIRData.decodedRawData;

Option A: Using my custom library
assume that I have my own header-only library called `MyIRcodes.h` installed in `Documents/Arduino/libraries/MyIRcodes/`.
- Always include it in code with:
#include &lt;MyIRcodes.h&gt;         
using namespace MyIR;   

option B: Use translated hexes:
constexpr uint32_t ONE      = 0xBA45FF00;
constexpr uint32_t TWO      = 0xB946FF00;
constexpr uint32_t THREE    = 0xB847FF00;
constexpr uint32_t FOUR     = 0xBB44FF00;
constexpr uint32_t FIVE     = 0xBF40FF00;
constexpr uint32_t SIX      = 0xBC43FF00;
constexpr uint32_t SEVEN    = 0xF807FF00;
constexpr uint32_t EIGHT    = 0xEA15FF00;
constexpr uint32_t NINE     = 0xF609FF00;
constexpr uint32_t STARBTN  = 0xE916FF00;
constexpr uint32_t ZERO     = 0xE619FF00;
constexpr uint32_t HASHBTN  = 0xF20DFF00;
constexpr uint32_t UPBTN    = 0xE718FF00;
constexpr uint32_t LEFTBTN  = 0xF708FF00;
constexpr uint32_t OKBTN    = 0xE31CFF00;
constexpr uint32_t RIGHTBTN = 0xA55AFF00;
constexpr uint32_t DOWNBTN  = 0xAD52FF00;
